Feature: Paypals Webhooks Basic Functionality
  Testing Paypals Webhooks API to Create, GetOne, Update, Delete Webhooks

  @api
  Scenario: Create a Webhook --> Get the same Webhook by Id --> Delete the Webhook
    Given I generate OAuth token with resource "/v1/oauth2/token"
    Then I form a client with this resource url "/v1/notifications/webhooks"
    Then I get the "request" content from "ScenarioRequests" file for the scenario "Scenario1"
    Then I make a "POST" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 201
    Then I extract value from response using json path "$.id" and store as "webhookId"
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "GET" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 200
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "DELETE" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 204

  @api
  Scenario: Create a Webhook --> Update (PATCH) the Webhook --> Get the same Webhook by Id to verify the update --> Delete the Webhook
    Given I generate OAuth token with resource "/v1/oauth2/token"
    Then I form a client with this resource url "/v1/notifications/webhooks"
    Then I get the "request" content from "ScenarioRequests" file for the scenario "Scenario2"
    Then I make a "POST" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 201
    Then I extract value from response using json path "$['id']" and store as "webhookId"
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "GET" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 200
    Then I get the "request" content from "ScenarioRequests" file for the scenario "PATCH_Scenario"
    And I modify the request payload with below values for respective json paths:
      | jsonPath        | value                                        |
      #| $[0].value         | https://example-<random>.com/another_webhook | # This wont work for JSONAssert
      | /0/value        | https://example-<random>.com/another_webhook |
      #| $[1].value[0].name | PAYMENT.SALE.REFUNDED                        | # This wont work for JSONAssert
      | /1/value/0/name | PAYMENT.SALE.REFUNDED                        |
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "PATCH" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 200
    Then I form a JsonPath and verify the output object with ExpectedObject:
      | JsonPath                    | ExpectedObject        |
      | $.event_types[0].name       | PAYMENT.SALE.REFUNDED |
      | $["event_types"][0]["name"] | Payment.Sale.Refunded |
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "GET" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 200
    Then I form a JsonPath and verify the output object with ExpectedObject:
      | JsonPath                    | ExpectedObject        |
      | $.event_types[0].name       | PAYMENT.SALE.REFUNDED |
      | $["event_types"][0]["name"] | Payment.Sale.Refunded |
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "DELETE" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 204

  @api
  Scenario: Create a Webhook by modifying the request payload values --> Get the same Webhook by Id --> Delete the Webhook
    Given I generate OAuth token with resource "/v1/oauth2/token"
    Then I form a client with this resource url "/v1/notifications/webhooks"
    Then I get the "request" content from "ScenarioRequests" file for the scenario "Scenario3"
    And I modify the request payload with below values for respective json paths:
      | jsonPath            | value                                            |
      #| $["url"]                    | https://example-<random>.com/yet_another_webhook |
      | /url                | https://example-<random>.com/yet_another_webhook |
      #| $["event_types"][0]["name"] | PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED                        |
      | /event_types/0/name | PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED                        |
    Then I make a "POST" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 201
    Then I extract value from response using json path "$['id']" and store as "webhookId"
    And I extract value from response using json path "$.url" and store as "createdWebhookUrl"
    And I extract value from response using json path "$.event_types[0].name" and store as "firstEventName"
    And I extract value from response using json path "$['event_types'][0]['name']" and store as "firstEventName"
    Then I form a JsonPath and verify the output object with ExpectedObject:
      | JsonPath                    | ExpectedObject            |
      | $.event_types[0].name       | PAYMENT.CAPTURE.COMPLETED |
      | $["event_types"][0]["name"] | Payment.Capture.Completed |
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "GET" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 200
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "DELETE" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 204

  @api
  Scenario: Create a Webhook with an already existing URL to verify the error response
    Given I generate OAuth token with resource "/v1/oauth2/token"
    Then I form a client with this resource url "/v1/notifications/webhooks"
    Then I get the "request" content from "ScenarioRequests" file for the scenario "Scenario3"
    Then I make a "POST" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 201
    Then I extract value from response using json path "$['id']" and store as "webhookId"
    Then I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "GET" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 200
    Then I form a client with this resource url "/v1/notifications/webhooks"
    Then I make a "POST" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 400
    And I get the "response" content from "ScenarioResponses" file for the scenario "Scenario4"
    #Then I validate the actual output response with expected api response
    Then I validate the actual output response with expected api response ignoring the below fields:
      | debug_id              |
      | details[0].event_type |
    And I form a client by manipulating the resource url with "/v1/notifications/webhooks/{webhookId}"
    Then I make a "DELETE" call with OAuth token and capture the response
    Then I should receive the HTTP status code in response as 204
